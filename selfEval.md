# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
This CFU didn't feel as overwhelming as the other ones did but I did work with Patrick and it helped to keep things in perspective. It was my favorite CFU so far.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
I need some help with that. Today was better than others as I had unexpected issues but it's good practice for the future. 
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
To work with others! I found it so helpful to work with Patrick through this assignment.
